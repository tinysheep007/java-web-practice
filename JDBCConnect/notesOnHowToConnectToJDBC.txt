We use driver Manager to connect with mySQL
the URL we use is 
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/study
"study" is the database name

If we are using mysql-connector.jar has version lower than 8.0
we also need to add this line before our try catch
//load in the driver manually
Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");

We must add our mysql-connector-java.jar file into our
reference libaray.

The location of the connection is usually under the installtion 
directory of mysql. Connector must be installed along with mySQL

The most often location is 
C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\Connector J 8.0\mysql-connector-java-8.0.28.jar

None Essientail stuff:
We can use the blow to print out the driver log
DriverManager.setLogWriter(new PrintWriter(System.out));
