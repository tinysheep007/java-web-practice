For SELECT:
statment.excuteQuery() would return back a ResultSet object
because we are SELECTing something and the data we got back
will be stored in the Result set.

For DELETE, UPDATE:
statament can also perform DQL or DML sentences. 
statement.executeUpdate()
iy would return back a int, representing how many lines/rows
are affected

we can also use the below to execute any SQL sentence
statement.excute()
It would return back a boolean, representing its a result a 
ResultSet or a int
We can use getResultSet() or getUpdateCount() to retrieve the info

If there are multiple statement we want to do, we can do
statement.addBatch(put ur query stuff here);
statement.excuteBatach();
