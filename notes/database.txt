1NF(weakest)： all the data cannot be splited anymore
Ex: student(id, into) -> student(id, phone, address)
last one it's in 1NF：

2NF: there must be a primary key so that other keys 
can be associate with it.
Ex: student(primary key(id), phone, address)

3NF: 
satisfying 2NF while other proerpty don't rely on its main id
Ex: borrowBooks(borrowID, studentID, bookID)
we can simply into 2 tables cuz of bookName and bookAuthor
borrowBooks(borrowID, studentID, bookID, bookName, bookAuthor)
book(bookID, bookName, bookAuthor)

BCNF(strongest):
NEED MORE STUDY ON THIS
Boyce - Codd normal form (or BCNF or 3.5NF) 
A relation is in BCNF if, X is superkey for every functional dependency (FD) X?Y in given relation.
