On the same internet, different device would be assigned different
IP address. We can access other device through IP address. However,
if  my phoine is on data and computer on wifi, my phone cannot
reach the computer because they are on different wifi.

To each individual apps on the computer and connect them to internet,
they mustt have their own port number and can be accessed and visited
through IP:port number format. Port number can only be from 0 to
65535.

IP address has 2 types. IPv4 which has 32 bits and IPv6 which has 128 bits.


TCP: more secured. We need hand shake 3 times. Connection must be established in order to
pass files in between devices.

UDP: faster and better performeed. No connection needed. Can transfer
data at any time. However, parts of data might be lost during the
transition.
